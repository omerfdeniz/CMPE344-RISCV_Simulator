\chapter{Execution \& Dependencies}
\noindent This simulator is tested and run on Windows 10 and Mac operating systems using Python 3.7. There are no other packages used other than those that come with Python 3 installation. Running the following terminal command on a folder that contains the code files and also a sample input program(described in Section 2.1) should be suffice to start the simulation.
